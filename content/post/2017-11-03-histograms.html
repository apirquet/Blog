<p>Hey there! Glad you’re back.</p>
<p>So far, we have covered Scatterplots and Time Series’. Now, we will be going over Histograms. Before we get started, you know the drill:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(ggplot2)</code></pre>
<p>To make it simple, let’s just look at the weight of the players and extract it from the Master table. The query should look like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>query&lt;-&quot;SELECT weight FROM Master&quot;
result&lt;-sqldf(query)</code></pre>
<p>Now, let’s discuss how to go about histogramming it up. First off, we are pretty much doing the same old same old with ggplot, however, instead of using <em>geom_point</em> or <em>geom_line</em>, we are going to be using <em>geom_histogram</em> (woah, shocker!).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(data=result,aes(x=weight),color=&quot;blue&quot;,fill=&quot;white&quot;,bins=60)+
  ggtitle(&quot;Distribution of Baseball Player Bodyweight&quot;)+
  xlab(&quot;Weight of player&quot;)+
  ylab(&quot;Number of players&quot;)</code></pre>

<p>Alright, so you may have noticed a few diferences here.</p>
<p>First and foremost, we changed the color of the bars. The <em>color</em> prompt decides the color of the outline, while <em>fill</em> is the inside of the bars (pretty easy).</p>
<p>Second, we added <em>bins</em> and indicated that we want only <strong>60</strong> of them. This decides how many bars we have. So let’s take a look at the histogram if we hadn’t added the bins prompt:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(data=result,aes(x=weight),color=&quot;blue&quot;,fill=&quot;white&quot;)+
  ggtitle(&quot;Distribution of Baseball Player Bodyweight&quot;)+
  xlab(&quot;Weight of player&quot;)+
  ylab(&quot;Number of players&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2017-11-03-histograms_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>See the difference? Alright cool cool. So you can change the number of bins as well. Take a look for yourself! Create an RScript file and plop that sucker in, then play around with the number of bins shown.</p>
<p>Next we will talk about barplots!</p>
