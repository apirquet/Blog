<p>Hey guys! So last post we talked about Scatterplots. In this post we are going to talk about Time Series plots!</p>
<p>Again, remember to bring in the necessary packages with library:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(ggplot2)</code></pre>
<p>Now that that’s done, lettuce jump into it!</p>
<p>Say we want to see Babe Ruth’s homeruns over his twenty-two seasons. This is the query we want to put in: (remember, we want to save this in <strong>“result”</strong>)</p>
<pre class="r"><code>query&lt;-&quot;SELECT yearID,HR FROM Batting WHERE playerID=&#39;ruthba01&#39;&quot;
result&lt;-sqldf(query)</code></pre>
<p>To put this information in a time series plot, we want to use the <em>geom_line</em> prompt. You can use <em>geom_point</em> as well, if you like. If not, you can either edit it out using <em>#</em> (to hide the prompt from being visualized), making the size of the points smaller (using the promt <em>size</em>), or just leaving it out of the query all together. Let me show you all three examples.</p>
<p>Here it is with an altered size:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot()+
  geom_point(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR),size=1)+
  geom_line(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR))+
  ggtitle(&quot;Babe Ruth&#39;s Homeruns by Year&quot;)+
  xlab(&quot;Year&quot;)+
  ylab(&quot;Number of Homeruns&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2017-11-03-time-series_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Using the <em>#</em> symbol to edit it out:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot()+
  #geom_point(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR),size=1)+
  geom_line(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR))+
  ggtitle(&quot;Babe Ruth&#39;s Homeruns by Year&quot;)+
  xlab(&quot;Year&quot;)+
  ylab(&quot;Number of Homeruns&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2017-11-03-time-series_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Or just leaving it out all together:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot()+
  geom_line(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR))+
  ggtitle(&quot;Babe Ruth&#39;s Homeruns by Year&quot;)+
  xlab(&quot;Year&quot;)+
  ylab(&quot;Number of Homeruns&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2017-11-03-time-series_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>And there you have it! Next post, let’s go over Histograms. See yah then!</p>
